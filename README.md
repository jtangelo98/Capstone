# Spring 2024 Capstone Project

This project is intended to help users monitor their spending and live within their budgets. It is an unlicensed, open source project that is not intended to be used as an actual product but to be used as a reference for how to write code in ReactJS.

This project was developed over the course of the Spring 2024 semester as my personal capstone project and is available to anyone who is interested in viewing/using it.

- Learned how tools such as Node Packet Manager, the ReactJS framework and React bootstrap are used to build web applications
- Learned how to write in an object oriented manner allowing components to be reused
- Learned how to use browsers such as Google Chrome to troubleshoot errors that occured in any given area of the applications
